DNS
===

Evan Rosson's domain name configuration. Automatically applied on `git push` using (dnscontrol)[https://dnscontrol.org/] and github actions.

TODO: secret subdomains. This repo makes all of my DNS configuration public, which I'm usually okay with, but I have a few private projects not included here.
