# [Evan's Infrastructure](..) > Tests

Simple read-only automated testing of my production infrastructure.

Includes tests like "does this redirect work" and "is the correct website running at this address".

Avoids tests like "was this application bug fixed" - those are for local unit/integration testing, packaged alongside each app's code.
